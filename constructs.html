                    creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and
                    then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly
                    moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

                    hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8
                    at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).</p>

                    shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you
                    must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the

                    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use
                    this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it
                    would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than
                    you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly
                    still in midair.

                <p>
                    To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must
                    succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

                    You squeeze what looks like the mouth of an eel on the body of a rat, so it bites your forearm. It
                    expands
                    into a bubble of blue-green, energy crackling within. You take aim, and lightning bolts forth from
                    your
                    fingertips.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In a cauldron of water, a voltaic fish -- For their bite, and their menace.</li>
                    <li>Add fleece -- For capacitance.</li>
                    <li>A twig from a lightning-struck tree -- For direction and aim.</li>
                    <li>A live rodent -- For they will temper the rest.</li>

                <p>A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc
                    of
                    lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit,
                    the
                    target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your
                    action
                    to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to
                    do
                    anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has
                    total
                    cover from you.</p>
                <p class="at-higher-levels"><span>At Higher Levels. </span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot
                    of
                    2nd level or higher, the
                    initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
