            <h2>Unworldly Tinkerer - lvl. 1</h2>
            <p>You have learnt how to transmute flora and fauna into unworldly creations. This is your way of harnessing the magic that flows in your blood. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells, but rather utilising alien creatures that manifest magical feats. These Constructs are parasitic to your arcane energy and will wither and die when away from you for an extended period of time.</p>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with Herbalism Kit, which is required in the creation of Constructs. If you already have proficiency, you instead have expertise with Herbalism Kit.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>At 1st level, you have perfected four unworldly Constructs, represented as Cantrips and are not destroyed upon use. You can select these from the Sorcerer and Druid Cantrips Lists.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Preparing and Creating Constructs</h3>
            <p>The Constructs Table shows how many Constructs you can have prepared at any given time and at any given level. Upon using one of these Constructs, it is expended and destroyed.</p>
            <p>It requires 30 minutes and 5 gold per level of the spell, to make one of these Constructs. The gold represents the price of procuring the necessary ingredients, these can otherwise be appropriately harvested.</p>
            <p>The Brujo has an innate understanding of how to make these constructs knowing Recipes (Spells) equal to the number of prepared Constructs Table plus 2 from the Sorcerer and Druid Spell Lists. These cannot be unlearned or replaced at a later date.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Constructs, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into these creatures. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

            <h2>Unworldly Origin - lvl. 1</h2>
            <p>You have been touched by an alien entity and bestowed a fragment of their power. You have been fundamentally changed by this, which awakens powerful magical abilities inside you, often altering your appearance in some way.</p>
            <p>At 1st level, you choose one of the cleric class's divine domains. You add that domain spells for 1st-level clerics to your known spells. These spells do not count against the number of spells you can know, and they are considered to be sorcerer spells for you. When you reach 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels in the sorcerer class, you likewise learn your domain's spells that become available at those levels.</p>

            <h3>Sorcerous Fortitude</h3>
            <p>As an action, you can spend any number of sorcery points to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled, or your Constitution Modifier (per die), whichever is higher.</p>
