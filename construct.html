        <h3 onclick="clicked(this)">Guidance</h3>
        <p>
            A stark white finger, half bone and half grub. It reacts to your request and in turn opens multiple small

        <p>
            A finger of purple mold on sandstone; you crush both bold and stone to dust in your palm and blow it at a

        <p>
            A finger of glistening black chitin and ghostly green mushrooms that sprout and wither, only to grow anew.

            stabilising the target.

            out of sync. Closely looking on the back, it seems padded in moss, and putting it to your face, appendages
            grasp you and hold it in place. The eyes open wide and bright like the moon and your appearance changes.
